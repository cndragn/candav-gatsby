I wanted to redevelop my site in React instead of WordPress. Using Gatsby to create this blog as a static site was super easy.

I've made most of my choices for getting my website done based on time.  When I first set up my portfolio, it was for a bootcamp project and I did it in HTML/CSS.

I wanted to redo it in Rails to use what I was learning, but wanted to get it up asap, so temporarily used WordPress.  I read how easy Jekyll is to get up and running so tried that, but every single thing I tried to do was a struggle and I moved back to WordPress.

It really is overkill for such a simple site, and "because its what I know" is a horrible way to make the decision on what to use, so I set out to find a better solution and decided on Gatsby.

## Why Gatsby

Like Jekyll, it's a static site generator. It's an SPA built on top of React so it's super fast, and uses GraphQL to fetch blog post data.  I also like how it uses templating with a pretty logical file system with internal linking.

GraphQL appealed to me as I've never used it before. Wasn't sure about the learning curve, but I've got to admit, getting Gatsby running and configured was so insanely easy that I did kind of feel like "...that's it?" After my experience with Jekyll, this was great.
