Originally, my website was based on WordPress (check out the [github repo](https://github.com/cndragn/wp-candav) of the custom theme I made) and then I decided to redesign and scale it down to just HTML/CSS.  While attending Wyncode, I wanted to write a blog of my experiences, so I checked out Jeckyll and it seemed like a great idea.  I was able to get it set up and running pretty quickly so that I could start writing pretty quickly.

Recently, while trying to polish up my site and blog, I came to realize that I miss the ease of use that comes with WordPress and the additional features it offers.  Some of that ease of use is just from my experience with it…  Taking a cue from what so many say on the internet, everyone seems to love Jekyll and prefer it over WordPress.  So…I had a choice to make, stick with it and figure out Jekyll because it seems pretty popular, or go back to using WordPress.  I decided on the latter, recreated my website design in a custom theme and am back up and running.

The major tipping point for me is that between working on my rails and react projects or developing my blog, I’d much rather spend my time on my projects.  I will reconsider Jekyll though because I really like the idea of being able to host my portfolio and blog on Github and not have to pay for hosting anymore.
